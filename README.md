# PIC10C-HW1

PIC10C-HW1 is a single-player version of the card game known as ‘siete y medio’. It plays the game itself and keeps a log of the rounds played against a dealer, stored as a text file called output.txt.

XCode's version control automatically wrote commit messages for merges. To see which merges were conflicting and had to be resolved, you'll have to click on the "..." icon next to the commit message. For example, the merge on Apr 24 does not have the icon, and did not have conflicts, whereas the merge on Apr 23, if you click the "...", had a conflict with "hw1withxcoderepo/siete-y-medio.cpp" that had to be resolved.
